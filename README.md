HARP.js Boilerplate
====================
My starter Harp.js app. Get prototyping in minutes, or use it to learn by example! This will set you up with a partial, a layout, global variables, and a bunch of other useful features such as stylus mixins, icon fonts, and more!

Usage
-----

* install [Node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* install Harp.js ```npm install -g harp```
* clone the repo
* start the server with ```harp server```
* get coding!
